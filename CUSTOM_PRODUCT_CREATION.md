# Custom Product Creation Page

## Overview

This custom product creation page solves the issue where uploading files directly in Payload's admin panel clears the form. Instead, files are uploaded to the media collection first, then selected for the product.

## How it Works

### 1. Media Upload
- Files are uploaded directly to the `/media` collection via API
- Images and files are stored separately and can be managed independently
- No form clearing issues since uploads happen outside the main form

### 2. Product Creation
- Uses a custom form interface instead of Payload's admin panel
- Allows both direct file upload and selection from existing media
- Maintains all form data during the process
- Creates products via API with proper user association

## Features

### File Upload
- **Direct Upload**: Upload new files directly from the form
- **Media Selection**: Choose from existing files in the media library
- **File Type Validation**: Separate handling for images and files
- **Size Limits**: 5MB for images, 50MB for other files

### Form Features
- **Real-time Validation**: Immediate feedback on required fields
- **Conditional Fields**: Delivery text/file based on delivery type
- **Category/Tag Selection**: Dropdown selection from existing options

### Media Library
