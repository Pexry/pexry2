# Buyer Purchases Page

This implementation provides a comprehensive buyer purchases page where users can view and manage their purchase history.

## 🎯 Features Created

### 1. Backend API (tRPC)
- **Orders Router** (`/src/modules/orders/server/procedures.ts`)
  - `getMyOrders`: Paginated list of user's orders with filtering by status
  - `getOrderById`: Detailed view of a specific order 
  - `getOrderStats`: Statistics dashboard (total orders, pending, paid, delivered, total spent)

### 2. Database Integration
- Leverages existing **Orders collection** in PayloadCMS
- Proper access control - users can only see their own orders
- Deep population of related data (products, vendors, media)

### 3. Frontend Components

#### Main View
- **PurchasesView** (`/src/modules/orders/ui/views/purchases-view.tsx`)
  - Responsive layout with infinite scroll
  - Status filtering (All, Pending, Paid, Delivered)
  - Empty state handling
  - Error handling with retry options

#### UI Components
- **OrderCard** (`/src/modules/orders/ui/components/order-card.tsx`)
  - Product image, name, and details
  - Order status badges with color coding
  - Vendor information
  - Transaction ID display
  - Action buttons (View Product, Product Details)
  - Responsive design for mobile/desktop

- **OrderStats** (`/src/modules/orders/ui/components/order-stats.tsx`)
  - Dashboard cards showing key metrics
  - Icons and clear visual hierarchy
  - Total orders, successful purchases, pending orders, total spent

### 4. Dashboard Integration
- Added "Purchases" to dashboard navigation
- Route: `/dashboard/purchases`
- Demo route: `/dashboard/purchases-demo` (shows sample data)

## 🚀 How It Works

### Order Status Flow
1. **Pending** - Order created, payment not completed
2. **Paid** - Payment successful, product ready for delivery  
3. **Delivered** - Product delivered to customer

### Key Features

- **Pagination**: Infinite scroll for large order lists
- **Status Tracking**: Visual badges showing order and delivery status
- **Product Access**: Direct links to purchased products
- **Vendor Info**: Display vendor/seller information

## 📱 User Experience

Each order displays:
- Product image and name

### Interactive Features

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Data Flow
1. **Authentication**: Protected routes require user login
2. **Data Fetching**: tRPC procedures with React Query
3. **Caching**: Automatic caching and invalidation
4. **State Management**: React Query handles loading/error states

### Security
